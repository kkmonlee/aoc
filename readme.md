# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2024. Each problem is solved using the language I felt was most suitable for the task at hand.

## Languages

The reasoning behind my language choices is consistent with my other competitive programming endeavours -- copy/pasted from my private repositories:

- Haskell: parsing nested structures, combinatorics, and graph algorithms.
- Rust: dynamic programming, bit manipulation, large dataset processing, and multithreading.
- Clojure: lazy sequences, grid-based problems, and higher-order functions.
- Ruby: text processing, quick prototyping, and regex-heavy tasks.
- Mathematica: geometric problems, algebraic manipulations, and number theory.
- C/C++: computational geometry and algorithms requiring low-level optimizations.
- Prolog: logic programming, constraint satisfaction problems, and graph/automata challenges.
- PARI/GP: number theory, modular arithmetic, prime-related problems.

## Notes

- Input files are not included in the repository since they differ for each user.
